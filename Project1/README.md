In this project, we will design, build, and populate a database for the Human Resources (HR) Department at the Tech ABC Corp, a video game company. 
This project will start with a request from the HR Manager. 

Design a database using the foundational principals of data architecture that is best suited to the department's needs
Documenting steps of database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams (ERD), and finally creating the database itself. 

This project is a scaled-down simulation of the kind of real-world assignments data architects work on every day.
