Documenting steps of database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams (ERD), and finally creating the database itself. 

This project is a scaled-down simulation of the kind of real-world assignments data architects work on every day.


Use this workpace to complete the project. 

The SQL script (StageTableLoad.sql) that will create a "proj_stg" table with all the data from the excel workbook ( no need to import the excel file into the workspace).
